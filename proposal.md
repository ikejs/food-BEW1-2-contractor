Online restaurant ordering in Django.

This will be a platform for restaurants to add their menu and accept online orders.
It is useful for restaurants that prefer hiring their own delivery/takeout staff. Restaurants can set item names, descriptions, images, addons and modifiers, as well as categories to nest items inside of. Additionally, a restaurant can have multiple menus and set available times that each menu is active.
